The project is based off of this article: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/

The article and the projects results suggest that their is a bias in Fandango's reviews where they are rating movies higher than they should be. This is most likely because 
Fandango sells the movie tickets to the same movies that they review and are thus encouraged to artificially boost ratings. 
My project explores that with things like distribution plots, scatter plots, etc., etc.

The project was outlined and assigned for me through this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/learn/lecture/22992400#notes
The course and tempmlate I used for the project were created by Jose Portilla which you can find more about here: https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/
